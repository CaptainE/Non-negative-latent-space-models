## Non-negative latent space models

This repository contains the material used for recreating the code used in:
-[Non-negative matrix factorization with gaussian process priors. Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience, 2008]
-[Bayesian Inference for Nonnegative Matrix Factorisation Models.Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience, 2009]
Both methods outperform the standard NMF algorithm from DD- Lee 2001:
- [Algorithms for Non-negative Matrix Factorization](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/1861-algorithms-for-non-negative-matrix-factorization)

Several files can be found including:
- [Report with results of the people collaborating on the project and](AML_preport.pdf)
- [A pdf file containing attemped proofs of several statements in the mentioned papers](AML_appendix.pdf)
- [Folder with code used for training and creatinf results](Code)

see our paper for more details.
